WIP

Design work by [**@oathkite**](https://github.com/oathkite): <https://www.figma.com/community/file/990997715540889664>

## Development

```sh
# Although this project uses "Zero-Installs", this is required probably due to
# unplugged packages. Not actually "Zero-Installs" :(
$ yarn

# Start Storybook on http://localhost:6006
$ yarn storybook
```

### Editor/IDE integration

See [the Yarn's official docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks).

$ yarn dlx @yarnpkg/pnpify --sdk <SDKs>
```
